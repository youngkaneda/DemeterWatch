    abstract = {This paper documents a compiled version of the Qualitas Corpus named Qualitas.class Corpus. We provide compiled Java projects for the 111 systems included in the corpus. We also gathered a large amount of metrics data (such as measurements from complexity, coupling, and CK metrics) about the systems. By making Qualitas.class Corpus public, our goal is to assist researchers by removing the compilation effort when conducting empirical studies.},
