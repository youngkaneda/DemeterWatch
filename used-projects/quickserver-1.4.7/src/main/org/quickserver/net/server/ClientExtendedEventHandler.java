/**
 * This interface defines the methods that should be implemented by any 
 * class that wants to handle extended client events.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Recommendations to be followed when implementing ClientExtendedEventHandler
 * <ul>
 * <li>Should have a default constructor. 
 * <li>Should be thread safe.
 * <li>It should not store any data that may is associated with a particular client. 
 * <li>If any client data is need to be saved from the client session,  
 * it should be saved to a {@link ClientData} class, which can be retrieved 
 * using handler.getClientData() method.
 * </ul>
 * </p>

 * <code><BLOCKQUOTE><pre>
