/**
 * This interface defines the methods that should be implemented by any 
 * class that wants to handle client events.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Recommendations to be followed when implementing ClientEventHandler
 * <ul>
 * <li>Should have a default constructor. 
 * <li>Should be thread safe.
 * <li>It should not store any data that may is associated with a particular client. 
 * <li>If any client data is need to be saved from the client session,  
 * it should be saved to a {@link ClientData} class, which can be retrieved 
 * using handler.getClientData() method.
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>If not ClientEventHandler is set for QuickServer then a 
 * default implementation {@link org.quickserver.net.server.impl.DefaultClientEventHandler} is used.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Ex:
 * <code><BLOCKQUOTE><pre>
package echoserver;

import java.net.*;
import java.io.*;

	public void gotConnected(ClientHandler handler)
		throws SocketTimeoutException, IOException {
		handler.sendSystemMsg("Connection opened : "+
			handler.getSocket().getInetAddress());

		handler.sendClientMsg("Welcome to EchoServer v1.0 ");
		handler.sendClientMsg("Note: Password = Username");
		handler.sendClientMsg("Send 'Quit' to exit");
	}

	public void lostConnection(ClientHandler handler) 
		throws IOException {
		handler.sendSystemMsg("Connection lost : " + 
			handler.getSocket().getInetAddress());
	}
	public void closingConnection(ClientHandler handler) 
		throws IOException {
		handler.sendSystemMsg("Connection closing : " + 
			handler.getSocket().getInetAddress());
