/**
 * This interface defines the methods that should be implemented by 
 * any class that wants to override default protocol of QsAdminServer 
 * or add new command specific to your application.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Recommendations to be followed when implementing ClientCommandHandler
 * <ul>
 * <li>Should be thread safe.
 * <li>It should not store any client data that may be needed in the 
 * implementation.
 * <li>If any client data is need to be saved from the client session,  
 * it should be saved to a {@link ClientData} class, which can be retrieved 
 * using handler.getClientData() method.
 * <li>Should have a default constructor - If QsAdminSupport is needed. 
 * </ul>
 * If you need to access the QuickServer you can use the code given below<br/>
 * <code>QuickServer myserver = (QuickServer) handler.getServer().getStoreObjects()[0];</code>
 * </p>
