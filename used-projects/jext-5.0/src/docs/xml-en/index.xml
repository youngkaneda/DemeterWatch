  <paragraph title="Overview">
    Jext is a powerful, pure Java text editor primarily targeted for use by programmers. 
    For this reason, Jext provides many useful programming functions: syntax colorization, auto
    indentation, a source code browser, a class browser, and an integrated console. Other users will
    find some additional advanced Jext functions useful. These include: HTML editing, the ability
    to send mail directly, scripting, and a configurable clip library. Lastly, Jext is fully
    customizable with the help of plugins and XML configuration files. This enables anyone to
    easily translate Jext from English into other languages.
  </paragraph>

    Jext is full of useful shortcuts which will help improve your productivity. After having 
    read this documentation, you will be able to make the most of all of Jext's many features.
