  <paragraph title="Overview">
    Workspaces are an easy and efficient way to manage your documents within Jext. Each workspace can contain
    a different set of files. The workspaces panel displays a list and two buttons. By default, the list contains an item called "Default".
    This is the default workspace, in which Jext will load files from the command line. You can create and remove
    workspaces by using the buttons.
  </paragraph>

  <paragraph title="Using the workspaces">
    To create a new workspace, simply click the first button. You'll be asked the workspace name. You can enter
    anything in the input dialog. Yet, you cannot create two workspaces with same name. The second
    button removes the selected workspace and closes all its contents.
  </paragraph>
  <paragraph>
    Files are opened within the selected workspace, linking them to that workspace. Whenever
    you click onto a workspace, the set of open files changes. To remove a file from the 
    current workspace, simply close it using the toolbar, the file menu or the popup menu. 
    To add a file to the current workspace, just open it. Note you can drag and drop files 
    over a workspace to open them. The workspaces and their contents are saved from one
    session to the next.
