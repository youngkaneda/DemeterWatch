           name="Edit Menu"
           title="Jext : Edit Menu"
           prev="jext-menus-file.html"
           next="jext-menus-search.html">

  <paragraph title="Overview">
    The <b>Edit</b> menu contains features specific to editing text, including
    basic text editing options (cut, copy, paste...) as well as advanced ones (expand
    abbreviation...).
  </paragraph>

  <menu title="Contents">
    <item name="Undo">
     Undoes the last editing action. For example, if you paste in the string "Hello World!", 
     <b>Undo</b> will remove it.
    </item>
    <item name="Redo">
      Redoes last <b>Undo</b> operation.
    </item>
    <item name="Copy">
      Copies the selected text from the text area to the system clipboard.
    </item>
    <item name="Cut">
      Cuts (i.e. copies then removes) the selected text to the system clipboard.
    </item>
    <item name="Paste">
      Inserts the contents of the system clipboard into the text area at the caret position.
    </item>
    <item name="Filtered Paste">
      Inserts the contents of the system clipboard into the text area after having performed a "search and
      replace all" operation on it. The patterns and options used for this purpose are the ones set
      in the Search And Replace dialog.
    </item>
    <item name="Insert Paste">
      Inserts the contents of system clipboard into the text area at the caret position. This
      function does not move caret after insertion.
    </item>
    <item name="Select All">
      Selects all the text.
    </item>
    <submenu title="Anchor">
      <item name="Set Anchor">
        Drops the anchor at the caret position. Note that this anchor is relative to the text
        and NOT an offset in the file. For instance, if you drop anchor in front of the word "Duke"
        at line 11, then delete the ten first lines, the anchor will still be in front of
        the word "Duke."
      </item>
      <item name="Goto Anchor">
        Places the caret at the anchor position. If the anchor hasn't been dropped (or set) yet, nothing
        happens. Read the explanation of the <b>Set Anchor</b> menu item carefully to understand
        why an anchor is so useful.
      </item>
      <item name="Exchange Caret/Anchor">
        Substitutes the caret with the anchor and vice versa. This means your caret is placed at the
        anchor position (as <b>Goto Anchor</b> does) and that the anchor is dropped at the caret's
        former position. In other words, they swap locations.
      </item>
      <item name="Select To Anchor">
        Selects text from the caret to the anchor, placing the caret at the anchor position.
      </item>
      <item name="Select From Anchor">
        Selects text from the anchor to the caret, leaving the caret in its current position.
      </item>
    </submenu>
    <submenu title="Source Code">
      <item name="Block Right Indent">
        Indents the selected block of text to the right. The amount of indent is controlled by
        the tab size option.
      </item>
      <item name="Block Left Indent">
        Does exactly the same as <b>Block Right Indent</b>, but to the left.
      </item>
      <item name="Jump To Matching Bracket">
        If the character under the caret is a brace, a bracket or a parenthesis, this function will move the
        caret to the matching one.
      </item>
      <item name="Box Comment">
        Encloses selected text in a wing comment adding a special character in front of
        each line. Comment characters depend on current selected syntax colorizing mode. For instance, Java,
        C and C++ modes will add <b>/*</b> at the beginning of the block and <b>*/</b> at its end and each
        line will begin with <b>*</b>.
      </item>
      <item name="Wing Comment">
        Encloses selected text in a wing comment. Comment characters depends on current selected
        syntax colorizing mode. For instance, Java, C and C++ modes will add <b>/*</b> at the
        beginning of the block and <b>*/</b> at its end.
      </item>
      <item name="Comment Block">
        Adds a single comment at the beginning of each selected line. In Java, C or C++ syntax
        colorizing mode, each line will begin with <b>//</b>. Comment characters depends on
        current selected syntax colorizing mode.
      </item>
      <item name="UnComment Block">
        Removes comment characters within the selected block of code.
      </item>
    </submenu>
    <submenu title="Text">
      <item name="Tabs To Spaces">
        Converts all tab characters in your text to the equivalent spaces.
      </item>
      <item name="Spaces To Tabs">
        If possible, converts spaces to tab characters. For example, if you set Tab Size
        to 8, each sequence of 8 spaces will be converted into a single tab character.
      </item>
      <item name="Begin Lines With">
        Displays an input dialog in which you have to enter some text. Jext then adds this
        text to the beginning of each selected line.
      </item>
      <item name="End Lines With">
        Displays an input dialog which prompts for text to be added to the end of each selected line.
      </item>
      <item name="To Upper Case">
        Turns each lower-case character of selected text to its upper-case equivalent.
      </item>
      <item name="To Lower Case">
        Turns each upper-case character of selected text to its lower-case equivalent.
      </item>
      <item name="Sort Lines">
        Sorts selected lines alphabetically using the first non-blank characters
        of each line.
      </item>
      <item name="Reverse Sort Lines">
        Sorts selected lines reverse alphabetically using the first non-blank characters
        of each line.
      </item>
      <item name="Join Lines">
        Joins the line on which the caret is placed with the next one. If the next line begins with more than one
        blank character, those characters are removed.
      </item>
      <item name="Join All Lines">
        Joins all lines contained in your text into a single line. This can greatly save space
        for Web pages (and in this way bandwidth and download times). However, it makes future 
        edits more difficult.
      </item>
      <item name="Remove End Spaces">
        Removes all white space characters from the end of each line of
        text. As with <b>Join All Lines</b>, using this feature can save some loading time
        for Web pages.
      </item>
      <item name="Transpose Lines">
        This function swaps the line of text located on the caret line with the
        previous line of text.
      </item>
      <item name="Complete Word">
        Tries to expand the current word. For instance, if you have already typed "thisIsAnotherVariable",
        it can be exhausting to retype it each time you need to use it, right? Instead, just begin
        to type it (type: "thisIsA", for example) and fire <b>Expand Abbreviation</b> action [Ctrl-b].
        Jext will auto-complete "thisIsA" to write the complete word for you ! If several words in the text
        match the abbreviation, a window pops up and let you choose the word you need.
      </item>
      <item name="Word Count">
        Displays summary information about the current document: the number
        of lines, characters, words and, for programmers only, real-code lines (this excludes blank
        and commented lines).
      </item>
    </submenu>
    <submenu title="File">
      <item name="Insert Extension">
        Inserts the current document's extension name at the caret.
      </item>
      <item name="Insert Full Name">
        Inserts the current document's full name (with extension) at the caret.
      </item>
      <item name="Insert Name">
        Inserts the current document's name (with no extension) at the caret.
      </item>
      <item name="Insert Full Path">
        Inserts the current document's full path (absolute path and file name) at the caret.
      </item>
      <item name="Insert Path">
        Inserts the current document's absolute path (without the full file name) at the caret.
      </item>
    </submenu>
    <item name="Goto Line">
      Displays an input dialog box which prompts for a line number. When <b>Ok</b> is clicked,
      Jext places the caret at the beginning of the specified line, if it exists.
    </item>
    <item name="Delete Line">
      Deletes the line on which the caret is placed.
    </item>
    <item name="Date/Time">
      Inserts the current date and time in your text at the caret.
    </item>
    <submenu title="One Click!">
      <item name="End One Click!">
        When you want to disable the <b>One Click!</b> feature, you can either use this item, either click
        any other menu item.
      </item>
      <item name="[an action]">
        <b>One Click!</b> menu items activate the <b>One Click!</b> system. You can tell if the feature is activated
        by the "one click!" message displayed in the bottom right corner of the text area. Once 
        activated, each click within the text area will perform an action. For instance, after
        having clicked <b>Paste</b>, each click will paste clipboard contents.
      </item>
    </submenu>
    <item name="Options">
      Displays the Jext options dialog. See the <a href="jext-options.html">Options</a> section
      for more information.
    </item>
  </menu>
