  <paragraph title="Overview">
    Bookmarks are placed in the tabbed pane called "Bookmarks" on the left part of the interface. This panel shows
    four buttons and a tree. The tree contains your bookmarks. These bookmarks are pointers, specified by you, to your most
    frequently accessed files.
  </paragraph>

  <paragraph title="Using the bookmarks">
    Using the buttons, you can create a folder, add selected opened file to the current folder, add all the opened
    files to current folder and remove selected file/folder. The remove button works if several items are selected
    (use <b>Shift</b> and <b>Control</b> keys combined to mouse clicks).
  </paragraph>
  <paragraph>
    To add a file to a given folder, either use the second and third buttons or drag and drop files onto a
    folder. To open a file from a folder, double-click it or select it and press <b>ENTER</b>. You can
    also select several files to open them at once. All the folders you've defined are saved with their contents
    on Jext exit.
