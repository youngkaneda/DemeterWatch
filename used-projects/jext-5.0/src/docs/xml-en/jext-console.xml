           name="Jext : Console"
           title="Console"
           prev="jext-search.html"
           next="jext-xinsert.html">

  <paragraph title="Overview">
    The Jext console behaves exactly like any system console (or terminal). Thus, it can be used
    to browse disks, launch applications, etc...
  </paragraph>

  <paragraph title="Using the console">
    First, the console is by default hidden. You have to go into the options menu and
    activate the check box named "Show top tabbed pane".
  </paragraph>
  <paragraph>
    To use the console, simply click in it and type in your command, followed by <b>ENTER</b>
    to execute it. The Jext console provides many internal commands and variables (which generaly
    change according to the current selected document) as well as special keys.
  </paragraph>

  <paragraph title="Console prompt">
    Jext lets the user customize the prompt. The Default prompt is in of the form
    <b>user_name@absolute_path &gt;</b>. In the options, you can change this prompt. Jext provides,
    in addition to this prompt, three defaults: Linux (<b>user@host%</b>), Solaris
    (<b>host%</b>) and DOS (<b>path &gt;</b>). To customize your prompt, enter any text in the
    prompt text field in the options dialog. You can use one of the
    four following variables:
    <menu>
      <item name="$u">
        Includes the current user name in the prompt
      </item>
      <item name="$h">
        Includes the current host (computer) name in the prompt
      </item>
      <item name="$p">
        Includes the current working directory in the prompt
      </item>
      <item name="$$">
        Includes the character '$' in the prompt
      </item>
    </menu>
  </paragraph>

  <menu title="Internal commands">
    <item name="help">
      Displays a summary of the console commands and variables.
    </item>
    <item name="clear">
      Clears the console screen.
    </item>
    <item name="cd">
      Change directory. This command is a little bit different from your
      OS one as it accepts both / and \ path separators depending on your OS is. It also offers the
      use of the ~ character which stands for your home directory. Type <b>cd -help</b> to get
      more information about it.
    </item>
    <item name="exit">
      Exits Jext.
    </item>
    <item name="home">
      This command does a <b>cd &lt;jext home dir&gt;</b>.
    </item>
    <item name="ls">
      Un*x users already know this command. Windows users have to know that this function is
      the equivalent of their dir command. The ls command accepts many flags, type <b>ls -help</b>
      to get a description of each of them. Note that the command <b>dir</b> can be substituted
      with the <b>ls</b> command.
    </item>
    <item name="pwd">
      Print working directory. This is useful when you choose a non-DOS prompt type (Linux or
      Solaris type).
    </item>
    <item name="file:filename">
      Typing <b>file:filename</b> will open the name file. The path to this file can
      be relative (i.e file:../infos.txt) or absolute (i.e file:/etc/.bashrc). Note the path is
      built using the cd command.
    </item>
    <item name="http://URL">
      Opens a specified URL. Typing <b>http://www.jext.com/index.html</b> will
      for instance open Jext (virtual ;-) web site welcome page in Jext.
    </item>
    <item name="run:scriptname">
      Runs the script <b>scriptname</b>. To get more informations about Jext internal scripts,
      please see the <a href="jext-scripts.html">Scripts section</a>.
    </item>
    <item name="eval:scriptlet">
      Evaluates the script "scriptlet" as a Python script.
    </item>
  </menu>

  <paragraph title="Using variables">
    If you insert an internal variable in your command, the console will automatically expand it
    to its current value before executing the command line. If you've opened the file
    Hello.java in /home/Gfx/java/hello and you want to compile it, even if you
    use the cd command to go in the directory /home/Gfx/java/hello, you won't be able to compile
    the file. This is a Java limitation (usually done for portability concerns). But you can do it 
    using a variable. To compile the file, just type the command <b>javac $n/Hello.java</b>. Then, 
    to run the class Hello.class, type <b>java -classpath $n $e</b>. Variables can be very useful
    in many other cases, to go to a subdirectory for instance: <b>cd $n</b> or to delete the 
    file: <b>rm -f $f</b> (Un*x users only).
  </paragraph>

  <menu title="Internal variables">
    <item name="$j">
      Jext home directory.
    </item>
    <item name="$h">
      User's home directory (/home/user under Un*x, C:\Windows or C:\Windows\Profiles\User under
      Win32 environment).
    </item>
    <item name="$d">
      Current directory.
    </item>
    <item name="$f">
      Current (selected document) file (designed by its absolute path. Ex: C:\Gfx\Login.rtf).
    </item>
    <item name="$p">
      Current (selected document) file name.
    </item>
    <item name="$e">
      Current (selected document) file name with no extension.
    </item>
    <item name="$n">
      Current (selected document) file directory.
    </item>
    <item name="$s">
      Selected text in the editor.
    </item>
  </menu>

  <paragraph title="Console keys">
    The console also provides many keys to simplify and streamline its use. Here is a list of them:
  </paragraph>
  <menu>
    <item name="ESCAPE">
      Deletes the whole command line. If you typed a long command line and then changed your
      mind, simply hit <b>ESCAPE</b> to clear it and place your caret at the prompt.
    </item>
    <item name="LEFT">
      Moves caret to the left in the command line.
    </item>
    <item name="RIGHT">
      Moves caret to the right in the command line.
    </item>
    <item name="UP">
      Get previous typed command from the history (up to 25 commands in the history, the history
      is saved from one session to the next).
    </item>
    <item name="DOWN">
      Get next typed command from the history.
    </item>
    <item name="TAB">
      Completes the file name if a match is found in the current directory. For example, if you
      are in the a directory containing the file <b>jext-patch-2.8.0.3.zip</b>, you can type
      <b>jext-</b> and then press <b>TAB</b> for Jext to automatically complete the file name. If
      several files begin with your shorthand name, the longest common part among those files
      names will be displayed.
    </item>
    <item name="S+TAB">
      Completes a command if a match is found in the history. For example, if you already typed the
      command <b>ls -rind</b>, then if you type <b>ls</b> in the console, and press
      <b>TAB</b>, the console will expand your command line to <b>ls -rind</b>.
    </item>
    <item name="C+c">
      Copies selected text to the clipboard.
    </item>
    <item name="C+d">
      Kills (terminates) current process. If you ran an app which seems to have crashed or
      needs to be terminated, press <b>C+d</b>. C+d used instead of the standard C+c 
      because C+c is already used for copying selected text.
    </item>
  </menu>
