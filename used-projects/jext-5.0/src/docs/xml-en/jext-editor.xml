  <paragraph title="Overview">
    The Jext text area is familiar to anyone who is used to a modern text editor.
    To add text, simply click in the area and enter your desired text. Beyond this basic usage,
    the Jext text area has many other useful features which are described below.
  </paragraph>

  <paragraph title="Popup menu">
    A right click in the text area will open the text area's popup menu. The popup menu
    contains many items from the Edit menu as well as others such as Search and Tools.
    Using the popup menu can increase your productivity.
  </paragraph>

  <paragraph title="Key shortcuts">
    As a matter of fact, Jext's text area accepts several key shortcuts which will greatly
    help you in writing your text. Shortcuts make selecting and moving text easier. Here is
    a list of them:
  </paragraph>

  <menu>
    <item name="TAB">
      Indents the selected block of code.
    </item>
    <item name="S+TAB">
      De-indents selected block.
    </item>
    <item name="CA+UP">
      Scrolls up the text view by one line without changing the caret position relative
      to the text.
    </item>
    <item name="CA+DOWN">
      Scrolls down the text view by one line without changing the caret position relative
      to the text.
    </item>
    <item name="CA+PAGE_UP">
      Scrolls up the text view by one page without changing the caret position relative
      to the text.
    </item>
    <item name="CA+PAGE_DOWN">

      to the text.
    </item>
    <item name="C+UP">
      Goes to the previous line, if one exists, starting at the first non-whitespace character.
    </item>
    <item name="C+DOWN">
      Goes to the next line, if one exists, starting at the first non-whitespace character.

    <item name="CA+LEFT|RIGHT">

      this shortcut will use them as separators. Very useful in programming.

      (depending on which caret, block or line respectively, you choose).
    </item>

  <paragraph title="Hyper Typer">
    The standard Jext distribution comes with a plugin called HyperTyper. This plugin helps you
    to save lots of time and typing. It is very easy to use: you define an abbreviation which
    stands for a string of text, type the shorthand sequence (the abbreviation), press
    <b>ESCAPE</b> (this expansion key can be changed in plugins options) and automagically,
    HyperTyper expands the shorthand sequence into the text you've defined. The defaults 
    are mainly designed for Java programmers, but because HyperTyper is so flexible, it's suitable to
    whatever line of work you're in. To add/remove/edit shorthands, click on Plugins-HyperTyper-Manager
    Window. Transient abbreviations are lost when Jext is closed whereas persistent ones will
    be available in the next session.
  </paragraph>
  <paragraph>
    To add a new sequence, simply select some text to be stored as expanded text
    and press <b>C+F5</b> (or click on Plugins-HyperTyper-Create Sequence). A new window appears
    which allows you to modify the selected text, to choose the type of the abbreviation 
    (transient or persistent), and to give it an abbreviation.
  </paragraph>

  <paragraph title="Gutter">
    Along the left of the text area, you can see a thin grey line which indicates the gutter is present.
    Double-clicking it or clicking then dragging it will show it. The gutter offers 
    line numbering of the text area and highlights line numbers every 5 lines. The gutter can
    be customized in the options menu.
