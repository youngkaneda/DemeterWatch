           title="Jext : File Menu"
           prev="jext-menus.html"
           next="jext-menus-edit.html">

  <paragraph title="Overview">
    The <b>File</b> menu contains features related to file management (open, save,
    new, etc.).
  </paragraph>

  <menu title="Contents">
    <item name="New File">
      Creates a new empty file with the current syntax colorizing mode enabled.
    </item>
    <item name="New From Template">
      Creates a new file from a selected template. You can set the templates directory in the options.
    </item>
    <item name="Clear File">
      Clears all text from the selected document.
    </item>
    <item name="Delete File">
      Erases the current file from your hard disk. You'll be prompted before deletion.
    </item>
    <item name="Open">
      Opens an existing file enabling the most appropriate syntax colorizing mode. If you open
      a ZIP or JAR file, Jext will open a ZipExplorer in which will prompt you to choose which
      packed file to open from the archive.
    </item>
    <item name="Open In Area">
      Works exactly like the Open function but does not create a new document in the interface. It
      replaces the selected document instead.
    </item>
    <item name="Open URL">
      Opens a file specified by its URL. This allows you to open a file from the Web or from
      your Intranet.
    </item>
    <item name="Recents">
      This submenu contains a list of recently opened files. By default it holds the eight most 
      recently opened files, but this can be configured in the Options pane.
    </item>
    <item name="Clear Recents">
      Flushes the contents of the Recents submenu. Use it to mask what you've been working on 
      or to prevent accidental access to recent files that no longer exist or aren't currently
      mounted (i.e. if they were opened from a removable device such as a CD-ROM or floppy disk).
    </item>
    <item name="Close">
      Closes the selected document. If this document was modified, Jext warns you and offers an 
      opportunity to save the document.
    </item>
    <item name="Close All">
      Closes all the open documents, asking to save any of them if they were modified.
    </item>
    <item name="Save">
      Saves the current document. If the current document is new (i.e. has not been opened from
      an existing file or has not been saved yet) Jext calls "Save As..."
    </item>
    <item name="Save All">
      Attempts to save all the opened documents.
    </item>
    <item name="Save As">
      Permits the current document to be saved with a different name.
    </item>
    <item name="Print">
      Prints the current document.
    </item>
    <item name="New Window">
      Creates a new Jext window.
    </item>
    <item name="Open In Window">
      Creates a new Jext window and opens an existing file in it, enabling the most appropriate
      syntax colorizing mode. Opening a ZIP or a JAR file initiates the same action as with the 
      normal Open command.
    </item>
    <item name="Close Window">
      Closes the current window and exits Jext if there are no remaining windows. If your work
      hasn't been saved yet, Jext asks you if you would like to save your changes before exiting.
    </item>
    <item name="Quit">
      Exits Jext by closing all its open windows and checking if your documents need to be
      saved or not.
    </item>
  </menu>
