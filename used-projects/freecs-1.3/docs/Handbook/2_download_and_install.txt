2.) Downloading / Installing

	2.1) Downloading FreeCS
		
		FreeCS may be downloaded as binary-package and source-package.
		To download the latest package go to http://freecs.sourceforge.net
		
		Due to limited time of our meatware it would also be a good idea to get in
		touch with CVS. Although i would suggest to join the CVS-Mailing-list to
		see, what happens and decied if it is good to update, or not.
		
	2.2) Installation
		
		Save the directories contained in the distribution you selected at your desired
		destination.
		
		2.2.1) Source distribution
			
			The sourcedistribution doesn't contain the compiled classes. You will need
			a Java SDK (version must be >= 1.4) to compile the sourcefiles.
			The package you downloaded contains a 'build' folder. This is the place
			where you will find the Ant buildenvironement. (http://ant.apache.org/)


			Win32:
			Set the correct JAVA_HOME envireonment-variable and execute
			> build.bat jar
			
			Linux/Unix:
			Edit build.sh to correct the location of your Java homedirectory.
			> build.sh jar
			
			This will compile the sources to class-files and jar's them into one jar-file,
			which will be found inside the lib/ folder. freecs-DATE.jar will be the name.
			
		2.2.2) Binary distribution
		
			The binary distribution already contains the jar-file. You will only have to
			lounch freeCS.
			
			Win32:
			doubleclick freecs.bat
			
			Linux/Unix:
			change to your freecs-directory and type (on RedHat compatible systems)
			freecs.sh start
			
			If you are using another Distribution, i would be glad if you could contribute
			a startscript for your distribution.
			
		2.2.3) Installing as service
		
			At the moment there is only a RedHat-startscript available. All people
			should feel very encuraged to suply their startscripts and solutions for
			starting as a service for their desired platform. 

			Linux/Unix:
			At the moment there is a RedHat compatible startscript available.
			Link the freecs.sh into your /etc/init.d/ folder
			
			ln -s /etc/init.d/freecs /your/freecs/folder/freecs.sh
			
			and type
			
			chkconfig --add freecs
			(this will automatically start and stop the service when changing runlevels
			 (rebooting, halting, starting ...))
