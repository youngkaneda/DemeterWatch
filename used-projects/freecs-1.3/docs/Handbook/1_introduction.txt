1.) What is freecs and what are the goals
	
	FreeCS is an OpenSource-WebChat. Webchats are chat-systems depending on HTTP as
	transportation-layer and HTML as the representation-language. Every normal webpage
	displayed in your browser does the same.
	
	One difference is the way the message-frame will be displayed, because it doesn't
	get loaded fully enabling it to display the new messages you recieve from other
	users or send by your selve. (Enabling it to get a web-chat at all...)
	
	FreeCS does let you configure the representation for nearly every little part a user
	will see. Messages and their appearence and all pages a user may get from the server.
	This customized templates will be transfered to it's users by using it's own built
	in http-server. (you may also serve gif's and jpeg's in a limited way)

	The FreeCS-Project was manely lounched to enable all users of a big community to
	chat with each other (This is also the reason why java-NIO was the best choice
	for this purpose). But the second but equivalently importent goal was to gain full
	controle over layout and integration-ability into an existing community.
	
	Coming down to our leading rule:
	Serve for as many users as possible in an as flexible way as possible :)
