1.) Download
    the latest distribution and extract it to your prefered 
    location. Find it here (http://freecs.sourceforge.net).

2.) Configure
   - Linux/UNIX:
     Open the freecs.sh-script. It is in fact a RedHat-
     compatible start-script, which allowes freecs to run 
     as daemon. Some things will have to be configured (like 
     the location of your java-homedirectory, documentation 
     inside)

   - Win32
     You have two possibilities: add your java-bin-directory 
     to your path or replace the java-call within freecs.bat 
     with the absolute path to your java.exe

3.) Start
    You are in fact ready to start with the default-layout and 
    the default-configuration.

There are other directories within your FreeCS-Folder which will 
be described here: 
- config
  containing the config.cfg-file which controls the behavior of 
  the chatserver 
- docs
  containing all documentation available at the time of creating
  the package 
- lib
  containing the .jar-file containing the classes of the 
  chatserver 
- templatesets
  containing subdirectories with the different templatesets 
  
  The default-subfolder contains the default-templateset, which 
  will be used if no other templateset is requested. To use a 
  special templateset, the client will have to submit a argument 
  called templateset=[foldername].

  Like this: 
  http://yourserver.domain.tl:port/?templateset=dark
  (HTTP-type POST is also supported)
