1.) Be sure to get the right JDBC-Driver from your database-vendor. 
    (In case of MySql, you can find this one @ 
    http://www.mysql.com/downloads/api-jdbc-stable.html)

2.) Copy the downloaded .jar, which contains the driver, into 
    /lib/ext of your FreeCS-Folder. 

3.) Configure
    For win32:
      Open freecs.bat, which is located in the root of your 
      freecs-folder. Add the JDBC-driver to the classpath by 
      changing the following line: 

java -classpath lib\freecs.jar freecs.Server

      into 

java -classpath lib\freecs.jar;lib\ext\your-jdbc-driver.jar freecs.Server

      and save it.

    For linux:
      Open freecs.sh which is located in the root of your 
      freecs-folder. Add the JDBC-driver to the classpath by 
      changing the following lines: 

# if sql-authentication is used, you will have to insert
# the path to your jdbc-driver here
# JARS=$JARS:$FREECS_HOME/lib/ext/mysql.jar

      into 

# if sql-authentication is used, you will have to insert
# the path to your jdbc-driver here
JARS=$JARS:$FREECS_HOME/lib/ext/your-jdbc-driver.jar

      and save it.
      
4.) Open up the config/config.cfg-file and change the following 
    lines: 
# which class to use for authentication
# and the config-file for this authentication-method
# authenticationClass=freecs.auth.SQLAuthenticator
# authenticationConfig=./config/auth.properties

    into 

# which class to use for authentication
# and the config-file for this authentication-method
authenticationClass=freecs.auth.SQLAuthenticator
authenticationConfig=./config/auth.properties

5.) Open the file identified by authenticationConfig (in our 
    case: config/auth.properties) and change all properties to 
    reflect your environment.
